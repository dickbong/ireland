 IRE_submarine_1:0 "Submarine I"
 IRE_submarine_2:0 "Submarine II"
 IRE_submarine_3:0 "Submarine III"
 IRE_submarine_4:0 "Submarine IV"
 IRE_submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 IRE_submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 IRE_submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 IRE_submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."
 IRE_destroyer_1:0 "Destroyer I"
 IRE_destroyer_2:0 "Destroyer II"
 IRE_destroyer_3:0 "Destroyer III"
 IRE_destroyer_4:0 "Destroyer IV"
 IRE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, the destroyers of the Great War must be repurposed and developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
 IRE_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 IRE_destroyer_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."
 IRE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The modern destroyer must be fitted with a variety of different detection technologies, new depth charge deployment systems and be built at a larger scale than their predecessors."
 IRE_light_cruiser_1:0 "Light Cruiser I"
 IRE_light_cruiser_2:0 "Light Cruiser II"
 IRE_light_cruiser_3:0 "Light Cruiser III"
 IRE_light_cruiser_4:0 "Light Cruiser IV"
 IRE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Maneuverable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 IRE_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Post-war treaties put restrictions on cruisers, but well-armed light vessels can be developed while remaining within these limits."
 IRE_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Now skirting the limits of treaties, larger and more heavily armored cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
 IRE_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Tactically employed to protect larger ships, the modern generation of light cruisers can shake off most past restrictions and be better armed to handle aerial attacks."
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Heavy Cruiser I"
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Heavy Cruiser II"
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Heavy Cruiser III"
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Heavy Cruiser IV"
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
 IRE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."
 IRE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Battlecruiser I"
 IRE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Battlecruiser II"
 IRE_battle_cruiser_3:0 "Battlecruiser III"
 IRE_battle_cruiser_4:0 "Battlecruiser IV"
 IRE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The post-war battlecruiser arms race resulted in several heavily armed designs, sacrificing armor for speed compared to battleships."
 IRE_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Rebuilt and repurposed battlecruisers continue to outrun even modern battleship designs by lighter protection, but have developed better systems for fire control, detection and aerial defenses."
 IRE_battleship_1:0 "Battleship I"
 IRE_battleship_2:0 "Battleship II"
 IRE_battleship_3:0 "Battleship III"
 IRE_battleship_4:0 "Battleship IV"
 IRE_battleship_5:0 "Battleship V"
 IRE_battleship_6:0 "Battleship VI"
 IRE_battleship_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 IRE_battleship_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 IRE_battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 IRE_battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."
 IRE_carrier_1:0 "Carrier I"
 IRE_carrier_2:0 "Carrier II"
 IRE_carrier_3:0 "Carrier III"
 IRE_carrier_4:0 "Carrier IV"
 IRE_carrier_5:0 "Carrier V"
 IRE_carrier_6:0 "Carrier VI"
 IRE_carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 IRE_carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy, while respecting the post-war naval treaties."
 IRE_carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
 IRE_carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."
 IRE_SH_battleship_1:0 "Super-Heavy Battleship I"
 IRE_SH_battleship_2:0 "Super-Heavy Battleship II"
 IRE_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 IRE_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."
