Furthermore, he accused the prime minister of being incapable of doing more than one hour's constructive work in a day.\n\nLady Londonderry, an influential society hostess, was more forthright; she has described Craig as "ga-ga".\n\nThe prime minister made an effort to address the Stormont Parliament where he personally rubbished the claims, before quickly retiring to his house in Craigavon. It appears he intends to continue without resignation."
